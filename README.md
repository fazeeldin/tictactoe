# tictactoe
This is a simple game of tic tac toe. Tic Tac Toe is a 2 player game. And the way the code is written is Human vs. Bot.

The game is made using python concepts of funcions, list, parameter passing, while loop and break.

A video has been uploaded on my YouTube channel with explanation for almost every line of code. Visit https://youtu.be/QBBb4yXs5pg for the video.
